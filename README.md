# Earth Travel

A rotating 3-D model of Earth. Can toggle Day/Night and Rotation, as well as turn the planet and zoom in or out.

In addition, there is an SVG map of every country, each of which can be toggled to "Traveled To" and "Lived In" or a defualt blank state.
This SVG can then be mapped directly onto the Earth model to show a 3-D model of every country the user has been to or lived in.
